  The proposed **SyncTalk** synthesizes synchronized talking head videos, employing tri-plane hash representations to maintain subject identity. It can generate synchronized lip movements, facial expressions, and stable head poses, and restores hair details to create high-resolution videos.

  ## Code

We will release the code after the paper is accepted.
